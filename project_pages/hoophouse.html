        <h1>
          A tool to manage environmental conditions inside Hoop Houses. Created
          for Western Engineering's Design course. Won the Client Choice Award
          in the Hoop House category.

        <p>
          A typical Hoop House. The material of the outer hoop traps moisture,
          allowing crops to be grown even during the winter.

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Our Hoop House controller was created with the goal to help Urban
          Farms, a local farm that uses Hoop Houses to grow crops year-round.
          After continued meetings with our client, we determined the following
          need statement:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <i
            >Urban Farms needs a user-friendly system to remotely control the
            temperature and humidity of his two hoop houses within 1Â°C and 5%
            error over a maximum two-day unattended period during winter months;
            this will reduce the time he has to stay on-site to manually
            maintain the houses and allow for better preservation of the crops.

        <h1>Functional Prototype</h1>
        <p>
          To demonstrate our solution, our team created a functional prototype
          pictured below. The prototype is equipped with sensors that can be
          installed in the actual Hoop Houses if necessary; a camera as well as
          a 2-in-1 temperature and humidity sensor. The sensors communicate with
          a Raspberry Pi processor, which compares the environmental conditions
          to ideal levels and operates the door under the assumption that doing
          so will allow cold winter air to flow in.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          A purely cosmetic recreation of a Hoop House to house our main
          components. Comes equipped with a functional door to mimic the process
          of Hoop House operation.

        <p>
          As the processor is located in-house, the system is capable of
          functioning fully autonomously. However, should the manager also want
          remote control and observation over the Hoop Houses, we also included
          this functionality through a progressive web application that I
          developed.

        <h1>Progressive Web Application</h1>
        <p>
          The progressive web app serves as a medium between the client and the
          Hoop House device. It allows the user to view the status of each Hoop
          House remotely, as well as remotely control operations in the Hoop
          Houses if necessary.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="fig2">
        <img src="/assets/hoop_house/phone.jpg" alt="phone" />
        <p>
          The main page of the progressive web app. Allows the user to compactly
          view the conditions of all Hoop Houses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="fig3">
        <p>
          Clicking on a Hoop House from the main page opens an updated view of
          the Hoop House as well as controls for the Hoop House.

        <img src="/assets/hoop_house/edit.jpg" alt="editpg" />
        <p>
          The editing page for a specific Hoop House. Allows the user to modify
          the name of the Hoop House as well as the ideal temperature and
          humidity levels.

        <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
        <p>
          Our project was largely a success; it received the highest score from
          the Hoop House's manager and won the Client's Choice award. However,
          there are still improvements that could have been made if we were
          given more time. One objective that wished to complete was to have the
          ability to track changes over time. This would have manifested itself
          in the form of a digital log within our progressive web app that would
          give the manager an idea of how the Hoop House was being managed if
          they were to give control to another employee.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Another improvement that we determined after sharing our service with
          numerous judges and students regards user authentication. Given the
          nature of our backend server, anyone with the knowledge of the
          server's IP address can access the Hoop House information and modify
          it as they see fit. To combat this, all that is needed is to add a
          wall to the server that prevents anyone from accessing the rest of the
          content until the passcode is entered.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Overall, I was very satisfied with the completion of this project.
          Throughout the creation of the project, I learned much about the
          entire design-thinking process, from empathizing with the client and
          ideating with my teammates to creating prototypes and refining them.
