        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          PickPro is a mobile app created in Flutter that is compatible with
          both Android and iOS devices. The app contains numerous features to
          help novice guitarists improve their guitar picking skills.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="txt-block">
        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>
          My inspiration for creating PickPro came from my dissatisfaction with
          the resources currently available for learning electric guitar. Not
          only were different resources often spread across multiple sites, many
          sites also locked key features behind paywalls that I didn't want to
          pay. Most prominent among them all, however, was the lack of
          readily available audio players with fine-tuned playback speed
          customization. Services like YouTube Music limit customizations to
          increments of 0.25 - 0.5x, gaps that are simply too large for a
          novice guitarist like myself to jump between when playing along.
        </p>

      <div class="txt-block">
        <h1>Metronome</h1>
        <p>
          PickPro includes a custom-built, animated metronome that can be 
          adjusted with the BPM text field or by sliding the counter-weight on 
          the metronome stick.
        </p>
        <br>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="sec-txt">
        <br>
        <p>
        The metronome animation was created using Flutter's <b>Tween</b> Object.
        Using a separate frame timer, the angle for the wand as well as the 
        required CurveTween is calculated using the method below:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="fig">
        <pre>
            <code class="language-dart">
double _getAngle() {
    double angle = 0.0;
    double segmentPercent;
    double begin;
    double end;
    Curve curve;
            
    int now = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
    double rotatePercent = 0;
            
    if (_metronomePlayer.metronomeIs == MetronomeIs.playing ||
        _metronomePlayer.metronomeIs == MetronomeIs.stopping) {
        int timePassed = now - _metronomePlayer.lastEvenTick;
            
        // Reset time interval if tick animation is delayed
        if (timePassed > _metronomePlayer.interval * 2) {
            timePassed -= (_metronomePlayer.interval * 2);
        }
            
        rotatePercent = (timePassed).toDouble() / (_metronomePlayer.interval * 2);
            
        // Restricting rotation in case of extreme intervals
        if (rotatePercent < 0 || rotatePercent > 1) {
            rotatePercent = min(1, max(0, rotatePercent));
        }
    }
            
    // Customize curve and angles depending on the rotation needed
    if (rotatePercent < 0.25) {
        segmentPercent = rotatePercent * 4;
        begin = 0;
        end = _maxAngle;
        curve = Curves.easeOut;
    } else if (rotatePercent < 0.75) {
        segmentPercent = (rotatePercent - 0.25) * 2;
        begin = _maxAngle;
        end = -_maxAngle;
        curve = Curves.easeInOut;
    } else {
        segmentPercent = (rotatePercent - 0.75) * 4;
        begin = -_maxAngle;
        end = 0;
        curve = Curves.easeIn;
    }
            
    // The Curve Tween is used to create the pendulum-swinging curve
    CurveTween curveTween = CurveTween(curve: curve);
    double easedPercent = curveTween.transform(segmentPercent);
            
    Tween<double> tween = Tween<double>(begin: begin, end: end);
    angle = tween.transform(easedPercent);
            
    return angle;
}

        <h1>Chords Reference</h1>
        <p>
          PickPro features a searchable chords list that includes a variation 
          of every single guitar chord. 
        </p>
        <br />
      </div>

      <div class="fig">
        <img src="/assets/pick_pro/chords_page.gif" alt="chords" />
        <p>
          Each chord can be easily found by searching for the note name as 
          well as the tune.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="txt-block">
        <h1>Audio Player</h1>
        <p>
          The main functionality of PickPro is its audio player. By uploading 
          their own music to the app, users can play their songs at custom
          and precise playback speeds. 
        </p>
        <br />
      </div>

      <div class="fig">
        <img src="/assets/pick_pro/player_page.gif" alt="player" />
        <p>
          Users can fine-tune the desired playback speed within 2 decimal 
          places, allowing them to slowly work their way up to playing 
          along at normal speed. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="txt-block">
        <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
        <p>
          The most glaring limitation with PickPro in its current state is the
          audio player's departure from BPM. Unless the user already knows 
          the BPM of the song, there is no way to sync up the metronome 
          function with the audio player; even if the BPM is known, the only
          way to sync these functions is by manually timing the playback of the song
          with the metronome.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        To solve this issue, there are two main upcoming functionalities that I would
        like to implement in the audio player. One is the ability to recognize the BPM of 
        the song, and the other is to sync the playback of the song with the built-in 
        metronome. As there exists software capable of recognizing BPM from audio files,
        the main issue will be implementing such software in Flutter. 
          </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Regardless, I believe that even in its current state, PickPro is an extremely
        useful tool for guitarists of all skill levels and I plan on continuing to use it myself
        to further my own guitar skills.
