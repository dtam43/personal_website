        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Altima provides a convenient but accurate platform for consumers and
          businesses to introduce alternative energy sources in their homes and
          offices. Using environmental data spanning over a year for any
          selected region, Altima can determine the efficiency rating of both
          solar and wind generators and combine it with average installation
          costs to provide its users with the ultimate alternative energy
          source.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Altima also supports user accounts which allow users to save
          previously visited locations in a log, making it easy to choose the
          most cost-efficient region.

        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p>
          Altima was constructed using a combination of Flask, Next.JS, React,
          and CockroachDB. To collect and compile data, we used
          <a href="https://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> and
          <a href="https://open-meteo.com">Open-Mateo</a>. Mapbox API was used
          for its interactive map, allowing the user to grab a specific location
          as they would on Google Maps; Open-Mateo's open-source Weather API
          gave us global weather data specific to each region.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          Extensive research was done to determine the effects of different
          weather conditions on solar and wind energy yields. This, combined
          with the installation costs for the region, allowed us to analyze the
          weather data of a certain region and determine which of the two
          sources would be more cost-effective over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          Finally, a user interface was implemented to allow for easier data
          logging and a better overall user experience.

        <h1>Determining the Optimal Energy Source</h1>
        <p>
          Altima uses a simple yet effective algorithm to determine a given
          location's suitability for solar and wind energy.

      <div class="algorithm-altima">

    tempScore = calcTemperatureScore(data['daily']['temperature_2m_min'], data['daily']['temperature_2m_max'])
    humidityScore = calcHumidityScore(data['daily']['temperature_2m_min'], data['daily']['apparent_temperature_min'], data['daily']['temperature_2m_max'], data['daily']['apparent_temperature_max'])
    windScore = calcWindScore(data['daily']['windspeed_10m_max'], data['daily']['windgusts_10m_max'])
        

    solarScore = 0.3*(tempScore) + 0.6*(humidityScore) + 0.1*(windScore)
    turbineScore = 0.1*(tempScore) + 0.3*(humidityScore) + 0.6*(windScore)

          Using data from scientific papers such as the impact of temperature on
          energy generation, we compared the relative effects of each
          environmental factor to quantitatively rank their significance, then
          implemented this weighted average into a simple cost per kWh for the
          user to see. From this code snippet, the weighted values for each
          environmental factor is as follows:

          Our algorithm's determined optimal energy source across each province

        <h1>What We Learned</h1>
        <p>
          An important lesson we learned in our time with Altima is to seek
          feedback, even during the creation phase. Even with a team of four
          people, it is common to overlook project aspects. In our case, when we
          took a break from our project to visit the panels, we spoke with many
          mentors and discussed what we had accomplished thus far. In our
          conversation with an RBC representative, we were given the idea to
          implement a user interface to add personalization and a better overall
          user experience. Without taking a step back from working and speaking
          with others, we never would have thought to improve the user interface
          for Altima and it ultimately would not be as polished as it is now.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="txt-block">
        <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
        <p>
          Going forward, we hope to implement more alternative energy sources in
          our regional analyses. Some alternative energy sources are locked to
          certain geographical regions, such as geothermal vents; others require
          multiple layers of thinking, such as hydropower requiring water,
          changes in elevation, and proper humidity. While solar and wind energy
          are generally the only options pursued by the general consumer today,
          we hope that with Altima, it may one day be possible to conveniently
          see the benefits of other alternative energy sources and ultimately
          move towards a net-zero world.
