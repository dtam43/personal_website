        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Ruin Raider is a top-down shooter created in Python using Pygame and
          Tiled. In the game, players take on the role of a mercenary hired to
          explore the ruins of a desolate world and collect valuable crystals
          known as Arctium. As they progress through the game, they must defeat
          various enemies, from basic crawlers to poisonous cave spiders and
          autonomous turrets.
        </p>

          In-game footage from the cave dungeon. This level includes unique
          poisionous spiders that paralyze and slow the player on hit.

        <h1>Game Development</h1>
        <p>
          Ruin Raider was constructed using object-oriented design principles.
          For example, enemies and players share a common “character” class to
          house movement logic, collectibles such as hearts and ammo share a
          common “item” class to house inventory logic, and all visible entities
          share a common “entity” class to house collision and sprite logic.
          Other core objects within the game include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Transform</b>: Dictates the position, rotation, and scale of the
            object for the purposes of collision and movement.
          </li>
          <li><b>Sprite</b>: Defines the sprite of the object.</li>
          <li><b>Light</b>: Defines the light source of the object.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <br />
          The levels for the game were created in Tiled, a software that allows
          one to export layers of drawn tiles as a collection of surfaces. This
          made it easy to extract objects from the levels; walls could be
          extracted for collision and fire sprites could be extracted for
          lighting.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          One of the levels as seen in Tiled's editor. The layers of the level
          can be easily separated into different pygame surfaces to simplify the
          programming process.

        <h1>Pathfinding</h1>
        <p>
          Ruin Raider utilizes a custom A* pathfinding algorithm that allows the
          enemies to track and chase the player around obstacles.

          An object called a Navmesh houses the matrix of nodes that determine
          if a given pathfinding agent can successfully move to a given point.
          To calculate the path, each node holds a reference to its neighbours
          and an f-score, which rates how beneficial the node is to a path. This
          f-score is the key to the A* algorithm and it is calculated using the
          sum of the path cost of the node (g score) and the distance between
          the node and the target (h score).

        <h1>Lighting Engine</h1>
        <p>
          This game utilizes an open-source lighting engine with real-time
          dynamic rendering to give the illusion of raytraced lighting.
        </p>
        <br />
      </div>

          A higher quality image from one of the game's dungeons. The dynamic
          lighting illuminates the player's surroundings as they move around the
          level, and collectibles hidden in the level also glow faintly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sec-txt">
        <p>
          The idea behind the lighting engine is that it layers pygame surfaces
          on top of all other rendered sprites, as they have unique rendering
          flags that allow them to be dynamically rendered. The source code for
          the lighting engine can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/LuckeyDuckey/Pygame_Lighting_Engine"

        <p>
          Ruin Raider features multiple weapons and multiple playable

          characters does not reset the player's level, but instead modifies

          Ruin Raider also includes a player progression system where players
          get stronger by defeating enemies. After progressing far enough,
          players are able to take on the ArctBeast, a final boss that offers a
          unique gameplay mechanic and valuable rewards.

          In-game footage of the final boss. Players defeat the boss by shooting
          its projectiles and reflecting them back towards it. This boss can be
          accessed at any time throughout the game regardless of if the player
          has enough HP to survive more than 1 hit.

        <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
        <p>
          Given the time frame my team had to complete the project, there are a
          number of things that we would have liked to include. Most notably, we
          would have liked to implement our own lighting engine rather than
          using an open-source one. This lighting engine is only able to project
          light radially outwards; by creating our own, we may have been able to
          make the lighting emerge from the player like a flashlight would,
          enhancing the immersive experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In terms of gameplay, we are satisfied with the experience of the
          current dungeons but we would have liked to have a larger selection of
          levels and enemies to explore. Additionally, having more varied weapon
          options, such as melee weapons, would have helped to broaden the
          gameplay experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In spite of this, I am satisfied with how the project turned out and
          find the game to be genuinely fun to play. To learn more about the
          game mechanics and to hear the custom music we created for the game,
          you can find the demo video for the game
